# Digital Financial Literacy Agent

This repository contains the project files for an AI agent designed to improve digital financial literacy. The agent provides information and guidance on financial topics to help users navigate the digital financial world safely and effectively.

## Project Description

The "Digital Financial Literacy Agent" is an AI-powered conversational tool built to answer user queries related to digital finance. It is designed to be a knowledgeable and friendly resource, offering guidance on topics like UPI, financial scams, and general financial literacy. The agent's knowledge base is enhanced by a vector database containing relevant documents, allowing it to provide detailed and accurate responses.

## Technologies Used

* **IBM Cloud**: The project was developed and deployed on the IBM Cloud platform, leveraging its powerful AI services.
* **IBM Granite Model**: The agent's core is built using the IBM Granite Model, a large language model that enables it to understand and generate human-like text.
* **Watsonx.ai Studio**: The project utilized IBM's Watsonx.ai Studio to set up and manage the AI agent, including creating and testing its functionality.
* **Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb)**: The repository includes the Jupyter Notebook file that was used to generate and configure the AI agent.
* **Python**: The agent's backend logic and code were implemented using Python.
